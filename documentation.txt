 Database Setup:

Create a database to store reservation details. The database should include tables for storing information such as reservation ID, guest details, table availability, reservation date and time, etc.
User Interface:

Design a user-friendly interface where guests can view available tables and make reservations. This can be a web page with a form to input reservation details.
Table Availability:

Implement a mechanism to track the availability of tables in real-time. This can be achieved by maintaining a table status flag in the database or using a separate table to store the availability of each table for specific time slots.
Reservation Process:

When a user selects a date and time for the reservation, the system should check the table availability for that specific time slot.
If a table is available, the user can proceed with the reservation by providing their contact details and any additional preferences.
The system should then generate a unique reservation ID and store the reservation details in the database.
Confirmation and Notifications:

Once the reservation is successfully made, the system should provide a confirmation message to the user, along with the reservation ID.
Additionally, the system can send an email or SMS notification to the guest, confirming their reservation and providing relevant details.
Manage Reservations:

Develop a backend system for hotel staff to manage reservations.
This system should allow staff members to view, modify, or cancel reservations based on guest requests or availability changes.
It should also provide a calendar or dashboard view to easily track upcoming reservations.
Error Handling:

Implement proper error handling throughout the reservation process. For example, if a table is not available for the selected date and time, the system should display an error message and suggest alternative options to the guest.
Reporting and Analytics:

If desired, you can include reporting and analytics features to track reservation trends, guest preferences, or other relevant data. This information can help the hotel optimize their table management and enhance the guest experience.
Remember that the above explanation provides a high-level logic flow for a table reservation system. As a developer, you will need to implement these steps in a programming language of your choice, using appropriate frameworks and technologies for web development and database management.

endpoints 

Here are some endpoints that you may need for your Express app:
/reservations: This endpoint can be used to get a list of all reservations.
/reservations/:id: This endpoint can be used to get a specific reservation by its ID.
/reservations: This endpoint can be used to create a new reservation.
/reservations/:id: This endpoint can be used to update an existing reservation.
/reservations/:id: This endpoint can be used to delete a reservation.
You can also add additional endpoints to support other features, such as:
/reservations/availability: This endpoint can be used to get the availability of tables for a specific date and time.
/reservations/guest/:id: This endpoint can be used to get the details of a guest by their ID.
/reservations/guest/:id/reservations: This endpoint can be used to get a list of all reservations for a specific guest.
/reservations/report: This endpoint can be used to get a report of all reservations.
The specific endpoints that you need will depend on the features of your app. However, these endpoints should give you a good starting point.
Here are some additional tips for designing your endpoints:
Use consistent naming conventions for your endpoints. This will make it easier for you and other developers to understand what each endpoint does.
Use meaningful HTTP verbs for your endpoints. For example, use the GET verb for endpoints that retrieve data and the POST verb for endpoints that create or update data.
Use proper error handling for your endpoints. This will help you to prevent and handle errors gracefully.
Document your endpoints. This will help other developers to understand how to use your app.
By following these tips, you can design endpoints that are easy to use and maintain.
